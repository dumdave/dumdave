- 👋 Hi, I’m @dumdave (Iota Discord handle)
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty well everything about Iota (and Shimmer)
- 🌱 I like to write guides that make lives easier for semi-technical people
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating DAO 'Web of Trust' structures for Iota, Shimmer and beyond
- 📫 Always best to reach me in the Iota Discord, but 
- also see my sites at www.TangleDust.com and www.ShimmerDAO.com
